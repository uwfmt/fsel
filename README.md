A CLI utility to manage file selections for batch operations in Linux
environments. Store, retrieve, and manipulate file lists between different
command runs. It keeps the list persistently until you remove it explicitly.

## Why?

Unix command-line utilities provide basic file operations such as copy, move,
rename, and delete, but lack a "select" operation. This utility fills that gap
by adding a "select" feature to the standard set of operations that available in
CLI. It just makes CLI file management great again!

Imagine you need to select hundreds/thousand of files scattered across various
directories and add them as arguments to a simple command like `cp`. Navigating
through directories with all the masks (like "?*") and even modern autocomplete
features makes this task cumbersome for editing, unless you're using a dedicated
file manager (like `Midnight Commander`, `Ranger` and so on).

With `fsel` and powerful search utilities with filtering, such as `fzf`, you
can easily compile the necessary list of files, iterating as needed and moving
through the file tree. Finally, you can use this list in a shell script or a
specific command (for example, in a loop: `for f in $(fsel); do cp -a "$f"; done`).

## Features

- Preserve selection between command calls using temporary files
- Accept arguments via stdin pipeline or as file arguments, including globbing
  pattern expansion
- Implement lockfile mechanism to prevent concurrency collisions
- Suited for really large selections (keep data on disk + uses index-based
  deduplication).
- `validate` (`-v`) â€” Validate the selection by checking if all stored file paths exist.

## Installation

### Requirements
- GNU/Linux system
- OpenSSL development libraries
- C compiler (gcc/clang)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uwfmt/fsel.git
cd fsel
make
sudo make install  # Optional, installs to /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage

**Utility is in development yet. Names of options and commands may be changed in future versions.**

### Basic Commands
```bash
fsel ~/*.log
fsel /var/lelog/**/*.log

for f in `fsel`; do mv $f /var/archive; done
```

### Advanced Examples
```bash
ls -1 *.bak | fsel

fzf -m | fsel

find /home -name '*.conf' | fsel

for f in `fsel -sc`; do cp $f /mnt/backup; done
```

Forcely overwrite old selections when it needed:

``` bash
fsel -fr important_file.*

fsel -u


```

## Operational Modes

| Mode        | Flag | Description                                              |
|-------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`       |      | Save file paths to selection, existing paths are ignored  |
| `replace`   | `-r` | Replace existing selection with new one                  |
| `list`      |      | Output stored into selection file paths (default)        |
| `clear`     | `-c` | Clear the selection                                      |
| `unlock`    | `-u` | Remove stale lockfile                                    |
| `validate`  | `-v` | Validate the selection                                   |

Also check man page for using details.

## Options

| Flag | Description                       |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| `-q` | Suppress informational messages   |
| `-s` | Sort files in selection on output |
| `-c` | Clear storage after output        |
| `-f` | Force operation ignoring lockfile |
| `-h` | Show usage information            |
| `-v` | Validate the selection            |
| `-l` | Long format output (like ls -l)   |

## Technical Details

- **Storage Location**: `$TMPDIR/fsel_<UID>.tmp` (defaults to `/tmp` if TMPDIR not set)
- **Index Files**: SHA-256 hashes in `$TMPDIR/fsel_<UID>.idx`
- **Lockfiles**: `$TMPDIR/fsel_<UID>.lock` for operation safety
- **Security**: 0600 permissions on all user files
